# CSS 2 - Data and Modeling in Computational Social Sciences

Syllabus -- Winter 2025

## Course Overview

This course will teach how you to think about **data** and **modeling** for **computational social science**. This will involve raising and examining questions like:

- How is a dataset **formatted**, and is this the appropriate format for what I want to do? 
- Is this dataset **representative** or does it reflect a **biased sample**? 
- What **ethical considerations** should I take into account when obtaining and analyzing data? 
- What kind of **model** is the most appropriate for these data? 
- How do I **design and implement** these models––ranging in complexity from [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) to [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine)? 

These topics will be discussed in the context of **hands-on practice** with real-world datasets in a **Python programming environment**.

## Key Learning Outcomes

This course is designed to give students a range of conceptual and technical tools. My goal is that by the end, you are able to:

- **Identify** and **explain** ethical issues that arise in CSS, along with analytical issues more broadly.  
- **Design** and **implement** clear, concise, and accurate visualizations of data.  
- **Propose** and **test** hypotheses about data using statistical models.  
- **Construct** statistical models in Python and **interpret** the results. 
- **Weigh** the pros and cons of different model evaluation metrics.

## Grading

### Grade Components
Your grade will be determined by three kinds of assessments: [coding labs](../labs/overview.md), [problem sets](../problem_sets/overview.md), and a [final project](../project/overview.md).


| Grade Component | Percentage of Final Grade |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| 8 Coding Labs | 50% (6.25% each) |
| 4 Problem Sets | 32% (8% each) |
| 1 Final Project| 18% |


### Letter Grades

If you're taking the course for a letter grade, your grade will be determined according to the scale below. 

Note that the number on the **right-hand** side of the range is *not included* in that range: that is, an "A-" ranges from 90% all the way to 91.99% but does not include 93% (93% is an A).

 <span>Percentage</span>        | <span>Letter Grade</span>
----------------------|----------------
97%+  | A+
93-97%   | A
90-93%   | A-
87-90%   | B+
83-87%   | B
80-83%   | B-
77-80%   | C+
73-77%   | C
70-73%   | C-
60-69%   | D
<60%     | F



### On Rounding 

Note that my policy is *not* to round up grades for two reasons:

1. If rounding is applied selectively (i.e., only to students who ask), it is unfair to other students.  
2. If rounding is applied across the board, it simply redefines the boundary between two letter grades (e.g., making an 89% the cut-off for an A-).


### Late submissions

Students may submit late assignments up to 48 hours after the submission deadline, for 75% credit of what you would've received (i.e., if you scored 90%, you'd get 67.5% with the late penalty).


## Questions, feedback, and communication

Instructors can be reached in the following ways:

- Office hours.  
- Public question on Piazza.  
- Private message over Piazza.  
- Email. 

The course Piazza can be found here: https://piazza.com/ucsd/winter2024/602

Note that in general, we prefer communication over Piazza as opposed to email. 


## Other Information

### Academic Integrity

Please turn in your own work. While you are encouraged to work together on some assignments (e.g., on [labs](../labs/overview.md)), you should still understand the code you've submitted. Problem sets and final project should be completed independently.

Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu). Cheating and plagiarism are unfair to other students and ultimately to yourself, and you will be penalized if caught. Instead, if you're struggling with something, please come to office hours and ask for help! 

### Class Conduct

All of us (instructors + students) should treat others with respect and follow the UC San Diego [Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html). This class should be a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, race, or ethnicity. 

Please be considerate and respectful of your fellow classmates (and instructors), refrain from discriminatory language and harassment, and interact with good faith.
